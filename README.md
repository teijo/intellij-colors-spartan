Spartan color scheme
====================

A very plain color scheme for IntelliJ IDEA focusing on highlighting structure and
errors. All code is of uniform color, only strings and comments have a distinguishing
color. Enhanced navigation and error highlighting.

Rationale
---------

 - IDE's error highlighting capabilities should be given highest visual priority
 - String contents aren't generally validated so they need extra care
 - Comments should exist for a reason, and therefore catch your eye


Installation
------------

Copy `Spartan.icls` to:

 - OS X: `~/Library/Preferences/IntelliJIdea14/colors`
 - Linux: `~/.IntelliJIdea14/config/colors`
 - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.IntelliJIdea14\config\colors`

IDEA must be restarted in order for the new color scheme to appear in the settings.
