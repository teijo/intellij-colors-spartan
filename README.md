Spartan color scheme
====================

A very plain color scheme for IntelliJ IDEA focusing on highlighting structure and
errors. All code is of uniform color, only strings and comments have a distinguishing
color. Enhanced navigation and error highlighting.

Rationale
---------

 - IDE's error highlighting capabilities should be given highest visual priority
 - String contents aren't generally validated so they need extra care
 - Comments must not be confused with code


Installation
------------

Copy `Spartan.icls` to:

 - OS X: `~/Library/Preferences/IntelliJIdea14/colors`
 - Linux: `~/.IntelliJIdea14/config/colors`
